## 2024-05-18 - Prevent XSS in Post Page Server Render
**Vulnerability:** XSS vulnerability in `app/posts/[slug]/page.tsx` where user-provided post content was directly injected using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` for the screen reader fallback (`<article className="sr-only">`).
**Learning:** Even visually hidden components (`sr-only`) that render user content directly using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` are vectors for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if not sanitized.
**Prevention:** Always wrap variables passed to `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with a sanitization function like `sanitizeHtml(content)` (which uses `isomorphic-dompurify`), regardless of where the element is rendered or its visibility.

## 2025-02-18 - Fix isomorphic-dompurify issue in edge runtime
**Vulnerability:** When Next.js crashes during SSR or in Edge runtimes with `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'bind')` originating from `isomorphic-dompurify/dist/browser.mjs`, it is due to an environment context bug where `DOMPurify` is undefined.
**Learning:** Some packages may be incompatible with the Edge runtime without defensive coding.
**Prevention:** Resolve this by patching the module to check for `DOMPurify` existence before binding methods (e.g., `DOMPurify && DOMPurify.sanitize ? ...`) or by safely managing its server-side execution.

## 2024-05-18 - Fix Authentication Bypass in Agent Endpoints
**Vulnerability:** Agent API endpoints (`create-thread`, `respond`) authorized requests by checking if the token matched an empty string fallback or started with `bot_token_`, completely bypassing real authentication for active bots. `symposium/step` lacked authorization entirely.
**Learning:** Hardcoded prefix matching (`bot_token_`) or `|| ''` fallbacks for environment variables in authorization logic creates severe security holes.
**Prevention:** Always strictly validate the `Authorization` header by checking a verified source of truth (like the `bot_profiles` database to ensure the bot is actually active) rather than trusting arbitrary token prefixes.

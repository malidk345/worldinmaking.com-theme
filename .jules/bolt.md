## 2024-11-20 - Memoizing the Customers Array in useCustomers
**Learning:** In the `useCustomers` hook, computing the large `customers` map on every render using an inner `.find()` array lookup created an $O(N \times M)$ rendering bottleneck, which cascaded re-renders down to dependent components like `Customer`. Pre-computing an $O(1)$ lookup Map and wrapping the operation in `useMemo` significantly reduces CPU pressure during React re-renders.
**Action:** When working with large sets of static or semi-static data (like `CUSTOMER_DATA`) joined against dynamic contexts (like `useProducts`), always precompute secondary maps for $O(1)$ lookups and wrap the final merged structure in `useMemo` to prevent deep performance regressions.

## 2024-11-20 - Array Flattening in SWR Infinite Hooks
**Learning:** Using `reduce` combined with array spread syntax (`[...acc, ...cur]`) for array flattening inside SWR Infinite hooks creates an O(N^2) rendering bottleneck due to redundant array allocations on each iteration.
**Action:** Always use the single-pass `flatMap()` (or `flat()`) method to combine paginated array data, ensuring O(N) allocation time and avoiding main thread blocking.
## 2024-08-08 - [O(N) object manipulation over O(N^2)]
**Learning:** Performance best practice for React hooks: If a component processes static data (e.g., mapping or sorting a static configuration object like `FEATURE_DATA`), move this computation completely outside the hook to a module-level constant. This ensures the O(N) operation executes exactly once per module load rather than repeatedly on every render or component instance. Also avoid using object spread (`...acc`) inside `reduce` loops to build objects (e.g., `Object.entries(data).reduce(...)`), as it causes O(N^2) time complexity and memory churn. Instead, use single-pass O(N) methods like `Object.fromEntries(Object.entries(data).map(...))`.
**Action:** Move feature data mapping into a module-level constant in `src/hooks/useFeatureOwnership.tsx` and refactor it to avoid O(N^2) operations during build to optimize performance.

## 2024-05-18 - Avoid O(N^2) reduce for object construction
**Learning:** Using `reduce` with object spread (`...acc`) to build objects dynamically from an array of entries causes O(N^2) time complexity and excessive memory churn, which can noticeably impact performance on large datasets.
**Action:** Always replace this pattern with `Object.fromEntries(Object.entries(data).map(...))` for a single-pass O(N) operation.
## 2026-08-12 - [Fix array-as-object anti-pattern in PricingCalculator]
**Learning:** Using `.reduce(..., [])` and assigning string properties to it forces the JS engine to de-optimize the array into dictionary mode. Using `{}` avoids this O(N) de-optimization.
**Action:** Always initialize reduces that return objects with `{}` or `{} as Record<string, any>`, never `[]`.

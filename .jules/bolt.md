## 2024-11-20 - Memoizing the Customers Array in useCustomers
**Learning:** In the `useCustomers` hook, computing the large `customers` map on every render using an inner `.find()` array lookup created an $O(N \times M)$ rendering bottleneck, which cascaded re-renders down to dependent components like `Customer`. Pre-computing an $O(1)$ lookup Map and wrapping the operation in `useMemo` significantly reduces CPU pressure during React re-renders.
**Action:** When working with large sets of static or semi-static data (like `CUSTOMER_DATA`) joined against dynamic contexts (like `useProducts`), always precompute secondary maps for $O(1)$ lookups and wrap the final merged structure in `useMemo` to prevent deep performance regressions.

## 2024-11-20 - Array Flattening in SWR Infinite Hooks
**Learning:** Using `reduce` combined with array spread syntax (`[...acc, ...cur]`) for array flattening inside SWR Infinite hooks creates an O(N^2) rendering bottleneck due to redundant array allocations on each iteration.
**Action:** Always use the single-pass `flatMap()` (or `flat()`) method to combine paginated array data, ensuring O(N) allocation time and avoiding main thread blocking.

## 2024-11-20 - Memoizing static processing outside hooks
**Learning:** Re-computing and sorting large datasets based on static constants (like `FEATURE_DATA`) inside hooks (even when somewhat contained by `useMemo`) incurs O(N^2) spread syntax overhead and redundant work on every render or across different component instances.
**Action:** Always lift static array mapping and sorting out of the hook entirely so it executes exactly once per module load, using O(N) operations like `.map` instead of `reduce` with `...acc`.
